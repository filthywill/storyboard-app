# Task ID: 1
# Title: Memory Management Foundation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement proper cleanup patterns to prevent memory leaks
# Details:
The Memory Management Foundation task has been completed successfully. I've implemented two key components:

1. Enhanced useObjectURLCleanup.ts hook with:
   - Memoized functions with useCallback for better performance
   - Comprehensive ObjectURL lifecycle management with automatic cleanup
   - A useSingleObjectURL hook for managing a single ObjectURL
   - A useMultipleObjectURLs hook with batch operations for multiple ObjectURLs
   - Standalone utility functions for cleaning up leaked ObjectURLs

2. Enhanced useCanvasCleanup.ts hook with:
   - Memoized functions with useCallback for better performance
   - Canvas context lifecycle management with proper cleanup
   - Additional utility functions for drawing and saving canvas content
   - Batch operations for multiple canvases
   - Standalone utility functions for cleaning up canvas elements outside component lifecycles

All acceptance criteria have been met:
- All ObjectURLs are automatically cleaned up
- Canvas contexts are properly disposed
- Memory leak detection and prevention is implemented

The implementation ensures proper cleanup on component unmount and provides utilities for manual cleanup when needed.

# Test Strategy:
Memory leak detection tests, browser memory profiling
