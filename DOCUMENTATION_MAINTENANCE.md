## 🔄 **End-of-Session Review Process**

### **Step 1: Use This Prompt**

At the end of any development session, ask your AI assistant:

```
🔍 Documentation Review for Today's Session

Please review our changes today and check:

1. Files Modified:
   - List all files we edited
   - Identify which are "critical" (Index.tsx, authStore, ProjectSwitcher, etc.)

2. State Changes:
   - Did we add/modify any UI states?
   - Did we change when states trigger?
   - Did we modify the state decision tree?

3. Flow Changes:
   - Did we change sign-in/sign-out flow?
   - Did we modify project switching?
   - Did we change offline/online sync?

4. New Rules:
   - Did we discover any "never do this" situations?
   - Should any new rules be added to .cursorrules?

5. Bug Fixes:
   - Did we fix any significant bugs?
   - Should they be documented?

6. Testing:
   - Do we need to add new test scenarios?
   - Should testing checklist be updated?

Based on your findings, please:
- List which documentation files need updates
- Provide specific sections to modify
- Draft the updates if changes are needed
- Update "Last Updated" dates

DO NOT make changes yet - just provide a review and recommendations.
```

### **Step 2: Review AI's Findings**

The AI will tell you:
- ✅ Which docs need updates
- ✅ Specific sections to modify
- ✅ Draft content for updates
- ✅ Whether any updates are needed at all

### **Step 3: Approve Updates**

If you agree with the AI's assessment, say:
```
Approved. Please update the documentation as recommended.
```

## 📊 **Weekly/Monthly Maintenance**

### **Weekly Check (5 minutes)**

Every week, verify:

```
Weekly Documentation Health Check:

1. Do the "Last Updated" dates reflect recent work?
2. Are there any TODO items in comments that should be documented?
3. Have we been following .cursorrules consistently?
4. Are there patterns we're repeating that should be documented?

If any issues found, note them for the next session.
```

### **Monthly Deep Review (30 minutes)**

Once a month, do a comprehensive review:

```
Monthly Documentation Audit:

1. Read through .cursorrules
   - Are all rules still relevant?
   - Are there new rules needed based on recent work?
   - Remove outdated rules

2. Review UI_STATE_HANDLING.md
   - Are all current states documented?
   - Are transitions accurate?
   - Update screenshots/diagrams if UI changed

3. Review ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md
   - Does it still match how the app works?
   - Have responsibilities shifted?
   - Update examples if outdated

4. Check Historical Docs
   - Are bug reports still relevant?
   - Should resolved issues be moved to archive?

5. Update DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
   - Add any new docs
   - Update "Priority Reading" if needed
   - Verify all links work

After review, update all "Last Updated" dates to current date.
```

## 🤖 **AI Assistant Integration**

### **Standard Prompts to Use**

#### **Before Starting Work:**
```
Before we begin, please review:
1. .cursorrules for critical rules
2. UI_STATE_HANDLING.md for affected states
3. Relevant sections of ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md

Confirm you understand the rules and constraints for this work.
```

#### **During Work:**
```
[When about to make significant changes]

Pause: Does this change affect:
- UI states?
- Auth flows?
- Offline/online behavior?
- Data validation?

If yes, what documentation will need updating?
```

#### **After Work:**
```
Session complete. Please:
1. Summarize what we changed
2. Identify documentation that needs updates
3. Check if we violated any rules from .cursorrules
4. Recommend any new rules based on issues encountered
```

## 🚨 **Red Flags: Documentation Out of Sync**

**Signs documentation needs immediate attention:**

1. **Code Review Confusion**
   - Reviewers asking "why are we doing it this way?"
   - Patterns don't match documented principles
   - Fix: Update principles or refactor code

2. **Repeated Mistakes**
   - Same bug/issue keeps occurring
   - Team members violating same rule
   - Fix: Add to `.cursorrules` prominently

3. **Onboarding Friction**
   - New developers confused by documentation
   - Documentation doesn't match actual code
   - Fix: Update docs to reflect reality

4. **AI Assistant Confusion**
   - Cursor AI making same mistakes repeatedly
   - AI suggesting patterns that violate rules
   - Fix: Update `.cursorrules` with clearer guidance

5. **State Mismatch**
   - UI shows states not in `UI_STATE_HANDLING.md`
   - Decision tree doesn't match Index.tsx
   - Fix: Immediate sync required

---

## 🔧 **Tools to Help**

### **Git Commit Hook** (Reminder)

To install the documentation reminder hook:

```bash
cd shot-flow-builder
cp .git-hooks/pre-commit-docs-reminder.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

This will prompt you before commits that modify critical files.

### **Documentation Diff Check**

Before major releases, run:

```bash
# Check when docs were last updated
ls -la *.md | grep "Last Updated"

# Check git history of documentation
git log --since="1 month ago" --oneline -- "*.md"

# If no updates in a month but code changed significantly, review docs
```

### **AI-Assisted Review**

Use this prompt monthly:

```
Documentation Consistency Audit:

Compare our current codebase structure with our documentation:

1. Check Index.tsx state logic vs UI_STATE_HANDLING.md decision tree
2. Check .cursorrules rules vs actual code patterns
3. Check ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md file responsibilities vs actual files
4. Identify any mismatches

Report findings and recommend specific updates.
```

## 📈 **Success Metrics**

**Good documentation health:**
- ✅ All critical files have "Last Updated" within 1 month
- ✅ .cursorrules matches current code patterns
- ✅ UI_STATE_HANDLING.md matches Index.tsx logic
- ✅ No repeated bugs that should have been caught by rules
- ✅ New team members can onboard using docs
- ✅ AI assistants follow documented patterns

**Poor documentation health:**
- ❌ "Last Updated" dates > 3 months old
- ❌ Code patterns violate documented principles
- ❌ AI assistants suggesting anti-patterns
- ❌ Repeated mistakes not documented in .cursorrules
- ❌ Index.tsx has states not in documentation

## 🎓 **Training for Team Members**

If adding team members, ensure they understand:

1. **Documentation is Code**
   - Treat doc updates like code changes
   - Review documentation in PRs
   - Test examples in documentation

2. **Update on Change**
   - Don't wait for "documentation sprint"
   - Update docs in same PR as code changes
   - Use end-of-session review prompt

3. **Reference Before Changing**
   - Read .cursorrules before ANY changes
   - Check UI_STATE_HANDLING.md before state changes
   - Verify ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md before refactoring
