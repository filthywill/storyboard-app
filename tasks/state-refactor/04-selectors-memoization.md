# 04. Selectors & Memoization

**Goal:**
Optimize state access with selectors and memoized computations for performance.

## Subtasks
- [ ] Identify expensive derived state/computations
- [ ] Implement selectors for common queries
- [ ] Use memoization (e.g., Zustand selectors, useMemo) where needed
- [ ] Profile and benchmark performance before/after

## Notes
- Memoized selectors reduce unnecessary re-renders.
- Document any performance wins or remaining bottlenecks.
