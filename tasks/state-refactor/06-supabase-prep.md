# 06. Supabase Sync Prep

**Goal:**
Identify and document what's needed to sync state with Supabase (single-user, not real-time yet).

## Subtasks
- [ ] List state fields to sync (storyboards, pages, shots, metadata)
- [ ] Plan Supabase schema (tables, columns, types)
- [ ] Identify fields needing transformation for storage (e.g., File blobs)
- [ ] Add placeholder sync methods (save/load)
- [ ] Document Supabase integration plan

## Notes
- MCP will help automate project/schema setup when ready.
- Focus on making state easy to serialize and upload/download.
